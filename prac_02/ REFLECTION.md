# Week 2 Practical Reflection

**1. What new things did you learn this week?**  
I learned how to break my code into smaller functions, and how useful that is for keeping things simple.

**2. What did you find most difficult?**  
At first, it was hard to figure out where to put the functions and how to pass data around. I kept getting confused about what should go inside `main()`.

**3. What part did you enjoy or think you did well in?**  
I liked using random numbers and creating the menu with options. I think I did well separating the logic into different functions.

**4. What would you do differently next time?**  
Next time I will write out a plan of my functions before coding. It will help me avoid mistakes.

**5. How do you feel about Git and GitHub so far?**  
It’s starting to make sense. I like how I can track what I’ve done, and it saves everything in case I mess up.
